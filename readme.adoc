http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/xdcr/xdcr-intro.html[Couchbase Cross Datacenter Replication] (XDCR) provides an easy way to replicate data from one cluster to another. This project has scripts that allows to create a Couchbase cluster over a Docker Swarm cluster. XDCR is then configured between these two Couchbase clusters.

Steps to create two Docker Swarm clusters, a Couchbase cluster in each, and setup XDCR between the two Couchbase cluster are below:

* To start local cluster A and B
+
```
run_all.sh

```
== TODO

* Run a simple application to write to cluster A and show replication in cluster B
